# refactor-me

To begin this project: [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository. 

This repository includes a complete `pandas` analysis of customer behavior in the `analyze.py` file. The file pulls in data from `data/raw/shopping_behavior_updated.csv` and prints out a few summary statistics on group aggregates in our dataset. 

However, while it runs successfully, it is badly designed and needs to be [refactored](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/refactoring). That is, we need to rewrite this code into more efficient statements while still preserving its functionality. 

Take a look at the `analyze.py` file and rewrite this code to address the following issues:

* poor variable naming conventions
* unnecessarily complex lines of code
* insufficient comments
* behavior that should be modularized into functions

Run your code after each change to ensure that the behavior remains the same. 

After implementing your changes, push your updated code to your forked repo.
